# wifiscanner
Main function see available Wifi networks and view how strong signal is. <br/>
2 buttons <br/>
1) button scroll in full list -when single scan active go back to list. <br/>
2) go back to list when single scan is active <br/>
Scan is done async. Normal scan takes too long. Data is refreshed in background when scan is finished.
This was quite a hurdle.

You get listing overview available Wifi and can select single wifi when list is provided.<br/>
I know project is a bit irrelevant (app available on phone) but still fun to make. Also it is a reference<br/>
for future projects. You can see how strong the reception is for you esp32 specific.<br/>
